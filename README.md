# Movie List App

This is a Django-based web application that allows users to create and manage their own movie lists. Users can register an account, create custom movie lists, and track the status of movies within each list. The application also provides a dynamic hero section that displays the overall status of all movie lists, including the number of created, ongoing, and completed lists.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can sign up for an account to access the movie list functionality.
- **Movie List Creation:** Registered users can create their own movie lists.
- **Dynamic Hero Section:** The hero section displays real-time statistics about the movie lists, including the number of created, ongoing, and completed lists.
- **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies by title, and the application fetches related movie information from a free API.
- **Movie Tracking:** Users can add movies to their lists, track movies they want to watch, and mark movies as watched.
- **REST API Integration:** The application employs REST API functionality to enable dynamic rendering of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the PostgreSQL database.
- **JavaScript Interactivity:** JavaScript is extensively used to enhance the user experience and make the application more dynamic.
